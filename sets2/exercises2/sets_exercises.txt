4.1. Write down examples for the following definitions. 
A set A (finite or infinite) is called countable if it is empty, or if there is a surjection N → A. 
Example: A = N is an example of such surjection if f(x) = x, A being infinite.
Also, more well-defined, a coutable set is a set in which all its elements can be paired with a natural number. Basically, they're what the word means: coutable. Can we count the rational numbers? Yes! It is a coutable set, even though it is infinite, because each rational can be mapped to a natural number if we follow a correct algorithm to make that map to number. Youtube has examples.

The power set of a set A,denoted 2^A, is the set of all subsets of A. 
Example: A = {1,2,3} means that 2^A = [{1},{2},{3},{1,2}...,{1,2,3}, empty]

For two sets A, B, we denote by B^A the set of all functions from A to B. This makes sense with the previous notation 2^A if we think 
of “2” as the set of two elements 2 = {0, 1}, and think of a function f : A → {0, 1} as
describing a subset C ⊂ A by sending elements of C to 1 and elements of A − C to 0. In
other words, the subset defined by f is C = f−1(1).

4.2. Recall that for A ⊂ X, AC sometimes denotes the complement18 of A in X. Prove
De Morgan’s law for sets, which for A, B ⊂ X states that (A ∩ B)C = AC ∪ BC, and (A ∪ B)
C = AC ∩ BC. Draw the connection between this and the corresponding laws
for negations of boolean formulas (e.g., not (a and b) == (not a) or (not b))
AC in our text editor will mean then X-A. 
Proof:
The Morgan's laws using diagram of Venn are trivial.
